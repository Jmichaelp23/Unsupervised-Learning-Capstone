    "The dataset is a collection of the inaugurals of all the presidents of the United States. My two aims of this project is to 1) using NLP, compare and contrast the most frequent words that the following presidents used: Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr, Clinton, Bush Jr and Obama. Then, we will use bag of words(BoW) and BoW features to create classification models such as linear regression, gradient boost, random forrest. which will determine if a word belongs to a presidents who is a democrat or to a president that is a republican.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) using TfidfVectorizer, analyse both Obama and Roosevelt's inaugurals. Furthermore, using SVD data reducer, we will optimise the process even further and will be able to group the sentences in the text into several different components and see how similar are they to each other."

      "0 On this day , we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises , the recriminations and worn - out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics .\n",
      "1 For us , they fought and died , in places like Concord and Gettysburg ; Normandy and Khe Sahn .\n",
      "2 These are the indicators of crisis , subject to data and statistics .\n",
      "3 Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans .\n",
      "4 Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life .\n",
      "5 On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord .\n",
      "6 As we consider the road that unfolds before us , we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who , at this very hour , patrol far - off deserts and distant mountains .\n",
      "7 I stand here today humbled by the task before us , grateful for the trust you have bestowed , mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors .\n",
      "8 For us , they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West ; endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth .\n",
      "9 To the people of poor nations , we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow ; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds .\n",
      "10 To the Muslim world , we seek a new way forward , based on mutual interest and mutual respect .\n",
      "11 Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real .\n",
      "12 For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength , not a weakness .\n",
      "13 That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood .\n"

    "Aim N 1: We found which are the most frequent words that the presidents used in their inaugurals.For example, Truman: 'world', Reagan - 'people', both Bus Sr and Clinton used 'new' most frequently and Obama used 'nation' the most. We created several different models to determine if a word belongs to a presidents who is a democrat or to e president that is a republican.\n",

    "Aim N 2: We used tfidf to divide the Obama and Roosevelt's inaugurals by paragraphs and determine the importance of the words in each sentence. We are not looking at the frequency only, but the weight of the words as well. We also reduced the number of the features and compared their similarity. The matrix shows low similarity between the components which means that the classification of each component is more distinct with the others."
